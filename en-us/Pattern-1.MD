## Every Fermat Number is divisible by 4

According to the adopted definition, a **Fermat Number** is an even number that, when divided by 2, still results in an even number. This implies that it is divisible by 2 **twice in a row**, without producing an odd number.

In mathematical terms:

$$
n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \mid \left( \frac{n}{2} \right)
$$

Therefore, every Fermat Number is **divisible by 4**, that is, there exists some $x \in \mathbb{N}$ such that:

$$
n = 4x
$$

### Examples:

| x | n = 4x |
|--------|--------------|
| 0      | 0            |
| 1      | 4            |
| 2      | 8            |
| 3      | 12           |

### Conclusion

> **Every Fermat Number is divisible by 4**, as it can be divided by 2 twice consecutively without generating an odd number.
